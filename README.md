# Icon-Combiner-App
Icon Combiner App is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to combine two ICO icons into one. The application uses CUDA (if available) or CPU for upscaling the icons to a user-specified size or automatically sizes them based on their original dimensions. It provides detailed logging for error tracking and debugging.
